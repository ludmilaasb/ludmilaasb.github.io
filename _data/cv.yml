    - <u>Hobbies:</u> I am a martial arts enthusiast (currently practicing Capoeira). 
      I like kind of games and one day I will build my own computer game. I also play 
      some instruments, such as pandeiro, guitar, and drums. I want to learn about synthesizes. 
    - I have three rats. They are very clever and lovable creatures. üêÄüêÄüêÄ
