  abstract = {In this work we have explored few tools in Quantum State 
  Tomography for Continuous Variable Systems. The concept of quantum states 
  in phase space representation is introduced in a simple manner by using a 
  few statistical concepts. Unlike most texts of Quantum information in which
   the Wigner function for a single mode is often more used, in this text the 
   multi-modes state Wigner function is also developed. Our numerical 
   investigations indicate that the reconstructed method using back-projection 
   add some error due the choice of cutoff frequency, therefore it is necessary 
   to use data post-processing, like the semi-definite programs, which provides 
   sufficient conditions correctly estimate the state. Once the information about
    the state is recovered, important features such as entanglement can also 
    be investigated.}

   of many-mode continuous variable systems. It is based on convex optimization 
   with semidefinite programs, and also includes a version of the maximum entropy 
   principle, in order to yield unbiased states. A key ingredient of the proposed 
   approach is the representation of the state in a truncated Fock basis. 
   As a bonus, the discrete finite representation allows to easily quantify 
   the entanglement.},

  abstract = {Noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms require novel paradigms 
              of error mitigation. To obtain noise-robust quantum computers, each 
              logical qubit is equipped with hundreds or thousands of physical 
              qubits. However, it is not possible to use memory-consuming 
              techniques for current quantum devices having at most hundreds or 
              thousands of physical qubits on their own. For specific problems, 
              valid quantum states have a unique structure as in the case of 
              Fock states and W states where the Hamming weight is fixed, and the 
              evolution takes place in a smaller subspace of the full Hilbert space. 
              With this preknowledge, some errors can be detected during the 
              evolution of the circuit, by filtering the states not obeying the 
              pattern through postselection. In this paper, we present mid-circuit 
              postselection schemes for frequently used encodings such as one-hot, 
              binary, gray, and domain-wall encoding. For the particular subspace 
              of one-hot states, we propose a method that works by compressing 
              the full Hilbert space to a smaller subspace, allowing projecting 
              to the desired subspace without using any ancilla qubits. 
              We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for the quantum 
              alternating operator ansatz algorithm. Our method is particularly 
              suitable for the currently available hardware, where measuring and r
              esetting are possible, but classical conditional operators are not.},

  abstract = {"With the emergence of quantum computers, a new field of algorithmic
   music composition has been initiated. The vast majority of previous work focuses 
   on music generation using gate-based quantum computers. An alternative model of 
   computation is adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), and a heuristic algorithm known 
   as quantum annealing running in the framework of AQC is a promising method for 
   solving optimization problems. In this chapter, we lay the groundwork for music 
   composition using quantum annealing. We approach the process of music composition 
   as an optimization problem. We describe the fundamental methodologies needed for 
   generating different aspects of music including melody, rhythm, and harmony. 
   The discussed techniques are illustrated through examples to ease the understanding. 
   The music pieces generated using D-Wave's quantum annealers are among the first 
   examples of their kind and presented within the scope of the chapter.},
