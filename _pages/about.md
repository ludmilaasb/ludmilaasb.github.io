I am Ludmila Botelho, a third year Doctoral Student at the [Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej, Polskiej Akademii Nauk (IITiS, PAN)](https://www.iitis.pl/), and the Joint Doctoral School, [Politechnika Śląska](https://www.polsl.pl/).

Currently I am working on quantum information and quantum computation, more specific in: quantum optimization algorithms and quantum annealing. I also have experience with tomography and entanglement on continuous variable states.

All my scientific papers are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fPMASBIAAAAJ&hl) but they are also available on arxiv. Take a look at my GitHub profile for the code I developed for my research and extras.

You can also check out my slides presentations [here](https://slides.com/ludmilaasb).
